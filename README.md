<h1>Usage:</h1>

It utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API in order to do so, found here: https://openweathermap.org/api. If a city/location provided cannot be found using the API, an error will be returned. A random background image using https://unplash.com is given as an underlay behind the weather app. To run this project, simply download the repository and open index.html in a browser of your choice.
